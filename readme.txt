Organize your discography; and offer downloads, streams and ways to buy your music.

== Description ==

Musicians need a way to easily organize information about their music.  This plugin
exists to do just that.  It lets you publish a list of albums and auto-generates 
a WordPress page for each song, so that fans can comment, save links to your songs
and share them with friends.

== Installation ==

Simply drop the files into a folder in your WordPress plugins folder.  Once
you've activated the plugin, go to Manage -> Discography in your WordPress
admin panel.  You'll have to set which WordPress page you want your discography
to appear on.  Once you've saved that, you are ready to get started.

== Roadmap == 

  * 0.2 - file uploads and management (mp3, images, etc.)
  * 0.3 - Custom data fields to let you store any arbitrary data with your music
  * 0.4 - User submitted content management and display
